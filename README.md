...`git remote add upstream https://github.com/AtlasRS/atlas-rs-main.git`

### Creating a PR

1. Always work on a separate branch from `master`
2. From your `work-branch` `git add <file-name>` (all files should be added separately)
3. Add a commit message `git commit -m 'your message goes here'` (all files should have separate commit messages)
4. Get most updated version by running `git pull upstream master`
5. Resolve any merge conflicts
4. Once all merge conflicts are resolved `push` to origin `git push origin <work-branch>`
5. Navigate to your personal repo and `create pull request`
6. Add detailed notes per file change
7. One other team member must review your `pull request` before it is merged with the master
